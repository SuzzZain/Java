Java Collection Framework (JCF)
The Java Collection Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces for handling groups of objects.
It includes interfaces, implementations, and algorithms to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. 
Collections can dynamically resize and are more flexible than traditional arrays.

Key Interfaces in the Collection Framework
The main interfaces in the Java Collection Framework are:

Collection: Root interface for all collections.
List: Ordered collection (allows duplicates).
Set: Unordered collection (no duplicates).
Queue: Collection for holding elements before processing.
Map: Collection of key-value pairs (no duplicate keys).


A List is an ordered collection (also known as a sequence). It allows duplicate elements and provides indexed access to its elements.

Implementations of List:
ArrayList: Resizable array implementation.
LinkedList: Doubly linked list implementation.
Vector: Similar to ArrayList but synchronized.
Stack: A subclass of Vector that implements a LIFO (Last In First Out) stack.
