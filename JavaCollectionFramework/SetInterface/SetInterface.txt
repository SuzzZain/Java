A Set is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements and has no specific order (except for SortedSet).

Implementations of Set:
HashSet: Implements a set based on a hash table. Does not guarantee order.
LinkedHashSet: Maintains insertion order.
TreeSet: Implements a set using a Red-Black tree and orders the elements (sorted).
