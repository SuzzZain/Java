An anonymous object is an object that is created without being assigned to any variable. It is typically used when you need the object for single use.

class Calculator {
    public void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an anonymous object
        new Calculator().add(5, 10);  // Output: Sum: 15
    }
}
