There are four main types of interfaces in Java:

Normal Interface: Can have multiple abstract methods and, from Java 8 onwards, default and static methods.
Example: Runnable, Comparator.

Marker Interface: An interface with no methods or fields, used to signal that a class has some specific property. For example, Serializable is a marker interface.
Example: Serializable, Cloneable.

Functional Interface: An interface with exactly one abstract method, used with lambda expressions.
Example: Runnable, Callable, ActionListener.

Tag Interface: Similar to marker interfaces, used to "tag" a class for a specific role.
Example: Remote.
